<p>Hosting your own Space Quest event is simple.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Find a place you would like to have your quest. It works best if you have a large space.</li>
    <li>Download the posters and print them. The graphics are scalable so you should be able to print them nice and large, for maximum effect.</li>
    <li>[optional] You may want to laminate your posters to make them weather-proof and reusable.</li>
    <li>Post your posters. Be careful not to damage property or nature with the posters.</li>
    <li>Tell people about your quest!
    <li>Remember to be considerate. Take your posters down when your event has finished. </li>
</ul>
