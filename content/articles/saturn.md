<p>Saturn is a gas giant, similar to the largest planet Jupiter, made of mostly Hydrogen and Helium gas. It does not have a solid surface or ground, although it most probably does have a rocky core.</p>

<p>Saturn has the most obvious rings of all the giant planets. Astronomers think these were formed when the planets were formed. Moons inside the rings, called "shepherd" moons,  stop the rings forming into another moon or floating away.</p>
