<p>The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma. It shines because of nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun radiates this energy mainly as visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light, and is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>
