To explore our Solar System, humans always send machines before people. To send people to Mars would be much more expensive than sending probes and robots. Mars has had many robot visitors in the past and currently has 2 active robot cars or rovers on it. They have tools for investigating the ground and for digging and drilling underneath the surface. They  also have onboard mini laboratories for performing experiments.
