<p>Astronomers put telescopes in space so they can take better pictures of space, than we can on Earth.  Sometimes this is because they do not suffer from problems because of the weather. Sometimes this is because the Earth's atmosphere blocks different types of light. Because of this, space telescopes can help astronomers find things they never would have seen before.</p>
